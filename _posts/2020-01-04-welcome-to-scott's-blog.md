Welcome to Scott's blog, a wonderful place full of magic and fun. In this first post, I'll be discussing the why and the how. That is, answering questions like, "aren't there enough blogs in the world already?" and "is this thing on WordPress or what?"

Well, to be honest, there probably are enough blogs in the world, but this one is mine and you're here to hear what I have to say. Thanks, by the way, for sticking with me this far. So, what is this blog all about then? I'd like to say, human consciousness, and the expansion there of. That may be too broad and grand or too narrow and specific. Really, this is a place about my consciousness and all that comes along with that.

After much deliberation, I decided not to publish my work on Medium, or Steemit, or Hive, or whatever next wave blogging platform I might have used. There's something nice and simple about keeping it here, in my own little world, don't you think? A bit about this site. It's hosted by GitHub pages, so thanks to the fine folks at Microsoft for giving something back to the world by offering this awesome free web hosting deal. Of course, since pages is only about static sites, there' no fancy WordPress or databases or backend code or front end code for that matter, just some simple HTML generated from Markdown by a cool little tool called Jekyll. Am I boring you yet? The point being, well, does there have to be a point?

What am I going to write about here. What I am going to write about here is my perceptions of the world, how it's changing, and how we can all be our best in order to live in the best possible world, evar. What I don't mean is, *Scott's top 10 ways to be really awesome* or anything like that, but rather a deep look at the non declarative processes available to humanity in order to discover unique, individual awesomeness. That said, I do plan to share what's worked for me in the humblest darn way that I can, in case anyone can learn something useful from my journey and mistakes. Not that I'm trying to rob you of your life experience, or anything. So go ahead, make those mistakes! If you've learned something cool and want to talk about it, please feel free to hit me up.

My interests are vast and varied (or you might say scattered obscure). I really like sound and language, in the form of spoken word poetry, conversations, and freewheeling monologues delivered to whomever will listen. Symbols and information also tickle me, so casual explorations of mathematics and computer programming, especially as they apply to art are also right up my alley. Maybe I'll write something about baking, or fermentation, or my mostly frustrated attempts to grow mushrooms. Maybe I'll share some insights from a book I'm reading.

To wrap things up, thanks again for stopping by my blog. I hope it's everything you hoped it would be. Please check back soon for more posts, and until then, stay juicy my friends.

â€”Scott
