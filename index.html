            <h2>Hey,</h2>
    				<!-- <h4 class="mb-4"></h4> -->

            <p>Thanks for stopping by. This site is all about me, Scott, and my mission here on planet Earth.</p>

            <p>You might be wondering what exactly I mean by my chosen job title. "Alchemy" is a mystical process whereby one thing is transformed into another, and that's what I do with the symbols of language and the signals of sound. This takes the form of creative poetic and musical expressions, as well as various services for individuals, groups, and businesses. Sometimes, the practice of alchemy is as simple as lending an attentive ear to someone who needs to be heard.</p>

            <p>I love helping others find the perfect voice for their projects. From a second set of eyes to complete ghost writing, hit me up if you're ready to get every word just right every time. Websites, blogs, books newsletters, love lettersâ€”you name it.</p>

            <p>I also love helping folks feel their best, using modern applications of techniques with ancient roots for relieving stress and pain using sound and self expression. It is my conviction that each person's voice is their own most powerful tool for healing, through physical vibration, cathartic release, and spiritual story telling. I also work with instruments, including singing bowls and drums, not just for the body but also for the expansion of conscious awareness and personal growth.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in working together or just want to say "hi", I'll be looking forward to hearing from you. Please call/text me at <a href="tel:+1-503-683-3677">503.683.3677</a> or email <a href="mailto:scott@scottyeager.co">scott@scottyeager.co</a>. This site is still under construction, so check back soon for more about me and my work. Thanks again for stopping by.</p>
